### brief about Quran-App

I had made Quran Application which display list of Quran's sura and when click on each one display it's ayat,you can go back for "الفهرس"  by click on button or click on "التالي " and "السابق " to go to previous and next one.
I had used angular 2+ and sass for design 
you can run Quran-app by two option the first git clone this link or download project
and write a command "ng serve -o"

### Running the application

git clone app and Run the application as an Angular application:
